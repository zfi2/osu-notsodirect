# osu!notsodirect

> no supporter? no problem!

osu!notsodirect is a hacky, but functional local replacement for osu!direct.
it downloads beatmaps from public mirrors and launches them through osu!, effectively auto-extracting them - just like the real osu!direct... but for free :3

## 💡 how it works

- downloads `.osz` files from public mirrors (like `catboy.best` or `nerinyan.moe`)
- auto-imports them into osu!
- requires *zero* changes to the game itself (no ban risk, no funny business)
- its also like... *blazingly fast*

## 🧱 setup and prerequisites
1.  **important notes:**
    -   ***THE GAME MUST RUN IN BORDERLESS FULLSCREN/BORDERLESS WINDOW!*** if it's not, it will minimize your game, and show the menu on your desktop.
    -   make sure you have **NET 9.0 Windows Desktop Runtime** installed. [download link](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/WindowsDesktop/9.0.4/windowsdesktop-runtime-9.0.4-win-x64.exe).
    -   if you wanna compile it yourself, make sure you have the **NET 9.0 Windows SDK** installed. [download link](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Sdk/9.0.203/dotnet-sdk-9.0.203-win-x64.exe)\

2.
    -   you can download and run the program from the Releases page on GitHub, or compile it yourself.
    -   when you press the **HOME** key on your keyboard you can **show/hide the overlay**, and **the F12 key shows the debug console**.

3.
    -   after doing these things, you should be set and ready to go! now just search for a map, click on the download button, and the map should auto-import itself to osu!

# osu!notsodirect

> no supporter? no problem!

osu!notsodirect is a hacky, but functional local replacement for osu!direct.
it downloads beatmaps from public mirrors and launches them through osu!, effectively auto-extracting them ‚Äî just like the real osu!direct... but for free :3

## üí° how it works

- downloads `.osz` files from public mirrors (like `catboy.best` or `nerinyan.moe`)
- auto-imports them into osu!
- requires *zero* changes to the game itself (no ban risk, no funny business)
- it's also like... *blazingly fast*

## üß± setup and prerequisites

1. **important notes:**
   - ***!!! THE GAME MUST RUN IN BORDERLESS FULLSCREEN/BORDERLESS WINDOW !!!*** if it's not, it will minimize your game, and show the menu on your desktop.
   - make sure you have **.NET 9.0 Windows Desktop Runtime** installed. [download link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0).
   - if you wanna compile it yourself, make sure you have the **.NET 9.0 Windows SDK** installed. [download link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)

2. **where to download and keybinds**
   - you can download and run the program from the releases page on github, or compile it yourself.
   - when you press the **HOME** key on your keyboard you can **show/hide the overlay**, and **the F12 key shows the debug console**.

3. **summary**
   - after doing these things, you should be set and ready to go! now just search for a map, click on the download button, and the map should auto-import itself to osu!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è possible issues
- borderless fullscreen introduces input delay, unfortunately, there's not much I can do to fix this, it's a stupid Windows issue. [Forced DWM buffering](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/774452?n=3)
- however, you can minimize the input lag by disabling Fullscreen Optimizations for the osu!.exe file, like this:
